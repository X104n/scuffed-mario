# Scuffed Mario
This is a student project in the class INF112 where we are set to make a digital version of the popular game "super mario bros", however, with a twist. I'd rather not spoil what the design twist is, so you'd have to look for yourself.

We're using libgdx and Tilded for this project.

## Build and run:
1. Clone the repository: ```git@git.app.uib.no:relish-earshot/scuffed-mario.git```
2. Open the project in IntelliJ or similar programs.
3. Run the program from the DesktopLauncher.java method. You should use the play-button in the top right or to the left of the method.

## How to play:
The game starts imminently when you start it in DesktopLauncher.java.

You move left with "A", and right with "D", you jump with "space". 

## Known bugs:
**Important!** We have audio in this game, however, it may be very loud, so be prepared for that.

There's currently a scaling issue, and is being worked on, see issue [#30](https://git.app.uib.no/relish-earshot/scuffed-mario/-/issues/30).
