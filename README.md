# Scuffed Mario
This is a student project in the class INF112 where we are set to make a digital version of the popular game "super mario bros", however, with a twist. I'd rather not spoil what the design twist is, so you'd have to look for yourself. Important to know; that the group is going for humor on the project. 

We're using libgdx and Tilded for this project.

The game works on Windows 10 and 11 and MacOS. Linux is untested.  

## Build and run:
1. Clone the repository: ```git@git.app.uib.no:relish-earshot/scuffed-mario.git```
2. Open the project in IntelliJ or similar programs.
3. Run the program from the DesktopLauncher.java method. You should use the play-button in the top right or to the left of the method.

## How to play:
The game starts in main menu, which you can either press "play" or "exit". 

You move left with "A", and right with "D", you jump with "space". 

"esc" to stop the game. 

## Known bugs:
There's currently a scaling issue, and is being worked on, see issue [#42](https://git.app.uib.no/relish-earshot/scuffed-mario/-/issues/42).
**THE GAME ONLY WORKS CORRECTLY WHEN NOT CHANGING THE SIZE OF THE WINDOW! (I.E NOT FULLSCREEN)**

**Important!** We have audio in this game, however, it may be very loud, so be prepared for that.
