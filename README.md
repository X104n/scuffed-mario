# Scuffed Mario
This is a student project in the class INF112 where we are set to make a digital version of the popular game "super mario bros", however, with a twist. I'd rather not spoil what the design twist is, so you'd have to look for yourself. Important to know; that the group is going for humor on the project. 

We're using libgdx and Tilded for this project.

The game works on Windows 10 and 11 and MacOS. Linux is untested.
